**DIFFERECES BETWEEN SQL & NOSQL DATABASES**

- SQL databases are databases that are relational and have their data structure strictly based on tables
- NOSQL databases are non- relational databases and their data structure can be based on documents, graphs
  key-value pairs allowing for more flexibility to work with unstructured data.

The following are a list of differences between SQL and NOSQL databases
- DATA MODELS: SQL databases require that tables and column properties are properly defined before data can
			   be added or updated so as to keep the data structured WHILE NOSQL database is dynamic, allowing
			   users to build an application without defining what the data-structure will look like, hence
			   allowing for database re-modifications without having to worry about structure and service
			   interruptions.


- DATA STRUCTURE: SQL databases are table-based WHILE NOSQL databases can be document-based, graph-based, key-value
				  pairs or wide-column stores. NoSQL databases are made to handle complex unstructured data.

- COST: SQL databases make use of  single server to host the entire database and require a bigger and more expensive
	    server WHILE NOSQL databases are usually cheaper by making use of cheap commodity servers.

- DEVELOPMENT MODEL: SQL databases are usually closed-source make money off licensing fees included in the use
					 of their software WHILE NOSQL databases are predominant amongst the open-source community.


2. - In the databases of Institutions like Banks, Schools, Freight-Handling, I imagine SQL databases
	 is the go-to type of database as the data here need to be strictly structured on tables.

   - Due to the complexity of social media applications like(instagram, tiktok, snapchat), The database needs
	 to be very flexible as they are usually in constant use and modification of unstructured data needs to be handles time-efficiently
	 without service interruptions.
